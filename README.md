# CSharp Extensions

This project encapsulates a number of useful and passionately tested extension methods designed to fascilitate writing functional, semantic C# code. 

See the [test project](https://github.com/KelsonBall/KelsonBall.CSharp.Extensions/tree/master/Kelson.CSharp.Extentions/Kelson.CSharp.Extensions.Tests) for examples.

## Todo
 
 * Rename `Curry` to `Apply` to reflect the difference between currying and partial function application.
 * Implement `Curry` for `Action<T, ...>`, `ParamAction<T, ...>`.
 * Write sample snippets so users do not need to use tests for documentation.
 * Reimplement `IsBetween<T>` to work with mismatched numeric types.
